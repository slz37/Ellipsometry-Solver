'''
Example script for MgB2 deposition on SiC and measured at a later time after an
oxide layer formed on top. This is an example of a double layer film.
MgO thickness of 4 nm was determined through estimation. MgB2 thickness of
40 nm was determined by AFM to confirm that this code works.
Read info.txt for more details.
